# LIRI

This project is all about taking the power back from Siri. With Liri, all you have to do is run the file and you'll be asked series of questions ultimately leading to your result. Be careful! Who knows what bugs I may have missed. For a working display, check this out: https://github.com/krayt0n3/Liri/blob/master/render1557173252576.gif
